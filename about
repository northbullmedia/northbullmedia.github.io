## Our Background

The origins of North Bull Media trace back to **Cars35**, an automotive content brand launched in **January 2023**. Cars35 began as a single Instagram page and grew rapidly through platform-native content formats focused on simplifying car research and ownership insights for Indian consumers.

As the ecosystem expanded into new verticals and distribution channels, the need for a structured holding company emerged. North Bull Media was formed to support a multi-brand portfolio approach and reduce reliance on any single platform or channel.
