## Founder Story

Cars35 was launched in 2023 as an automotive Instagram page and quickly expanded into a broader ecosystem of automotive and mobility brands. After facing multiple platform suspensions due to copyright strikes, the founders rebuilt their network using a multi-brand and multi-platform strategy.

In 2026, North Bull Media was formally established as the parent company to consolidate existing brands and support the launch of future vertical media properties.
